### Known Issues

I can't fix any of those as of now expect the level ranges but this will take time, a lot of time!

- Enemies are way outside the expected level range. I might make some adjustments but overall I'm ok with that.

- Nighteye looks grey. Doesn't look good but at least it works. I don't really know how to change that and every attempt i made borked it completely. Grey it is!

- When you die as a vampire **without sleeping in a coffin first** the game will put you into a weird death state. Just reload or even better, sleep in a coffin asap after becoming a vampire

- Sometimes you stagger on combat start. Looks weird but the same is true for any enemy, so it remains fair

- PermaDeath mod doesn't generate a life at the start of the playthrough. It's a known issue with the mod as of now please refer to the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66710)

- Wolves: they sometimes are invincible during power attacks and some wolves *glide* around on the floor. Most wolves are fine and I wait on a mod update that fixes that cause removing the wolf behavior mod is a bad idea due to wolves having the ability to stun lock you to death when there are 3 of them.
