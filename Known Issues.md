### Known Issues


- rebinding keys in any MCM crashes the game if you play with a controller afterwards. (sadly i can't do anything about that at the moment as it appears to be a SKSE issue or a Skyrim issue. to change your keybindings you need to change them in the MCM --> save the game --> close the game and restart. Keybindings are saved and everything works as it should again
