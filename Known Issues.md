### Known Issues


- rebinding keys in any MCM crashes the game if you play with a controller afterwards. Sadly i can't do anything about that at the moment as it appears to be a SKSE issue or a Skyrim issue. to change your keybindings you need to:
1. change them in the MCM
2. save the game
3. close the game and restart. The keybindings are now saved and everything works as it should again
