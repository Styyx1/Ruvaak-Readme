### Known Issues

- Enemies are way outside the expected level range. I might make some adjustments but overall I'm ok with that.
- When rapid fire is on. Sometimes the bow draws in slow motion. The fix is toggling it off and on again.
- Equipment is clipping. use ``ctrl+backspace`` to enter IED's menus and adjust to your liking. I edited it a bit but due to the sheer amount of different shaped armors it will never fit with all of them
- Vampire Sneak feeding and Sneak tools don't play well together. I try to find a fix but in the mean time you need to disable assassination in the Sneak Tools MCM in order to feed while sneaking
- Arrow trails stuck on ground. I'll try to fix it but first I need to find out what causes it. it's nothing gamebreaking though.
