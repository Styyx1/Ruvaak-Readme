### Known Issues


- rebinding keys in any MCM crashes the game if you play with a controller afterwards. Sadly i can't do anything about that at the moment as it appears to be a SKSE issue or a Skyrim issue. to change your keybindings you need to:
1. change them in the MCM
2. save the game
3. close the game and restart. The keybindings are now saved and everything works as it should again

- Sometimes your character will turn invisible and visible seemingly random. While i don't know the cause of it, usually a simple quicksave followed by quickloading gets rid of it

- I can't draw weapons underwater: Yes that's known and the mod author didn't find a fix for that. So till the mod gets an update, (highly unlikely) you need to draw your weapons before going on a deep sea hunt
