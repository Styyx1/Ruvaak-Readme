### Known Issues

- Sometimes your character will turn invisible and visible seemingly random. While i don't know the cause of it, usually a simple quicksave followed by quickloading gets rid of it

- I can't draw weapons underwater: Yes that's known and the mod author didn't find a fix for that. So till the mod gets an update, (highly unlikely) you need to draw your weapons before going on a deep sea hunt

- Enemies are way outside the expected level range. I might make some adjustments but overall I'm ok with that.

- Nighteye looks grey. Doesn't look good but at least it works. I don't really know how to change that and every attempt i made borked it completely. Grey it is!

- When you die as a vampire **without sleeping in a coffin first** the game will put you into a weird death state. Just reload or even better, sleep in a coffin asap after becoming a vampire
