### Known Issues

- Enemies are way outside the expected level range. I might make some adjustments but overall I'm ok with that.

- Nighteye looks grey. Doesn't look good but at least it works. I don't really know how to change that and every attempt i made borked it completely. Grey it is!

- When you die as a vampire **without sleeping in a coffin first** the game will put you into a weird death state. Just reload or even better, sleep in a coffin asap after becoming a vampire

- Sometimes you stagger on combat start. Looks weird but the same is true for any enemy, so it remains fair
