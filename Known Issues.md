### Known Issues

- Enemies are way outside the expected level range. I might make some adjustments but overall I'm ok with that.
- When rapid fire is on. Sometimes the bow draws in slow motion. The fix is toggling it off and on again.
- Equipment is clipping. use ``ctrl+backspace`` to enter IED's menus and adjust to your liking. I edited it a bit but due to the sheer amount of different shaped armors it will never fit with all of them
- Vampire Sneak feeding and Sneak tools don't play well together. I try to find a fix but in the mean time you need to disable assassination in the Sneak Tools MCM in order to feed while sneaking
- [Hemomancy Spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74968) don't level up the destruction skill. This is intended by the author and i won't change it for that very reason.
- Clockwork NPCs are missing their heads inside the castle. That's due to [Dynamic Armor Variants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65963) and I haven't found a way yet to prevent it. You can either overlook it like I do or remove/rename the ``DAV_HiddenEquipment.json`` file while you're there.
- colorful wood structures: There are a few weird looking wood structures and I still don't know how to fix it. If you know, please tell me, other than that, it will be fixed as soon as I know how.
