**What's the name of the mod and please provide a nexus link to it**
My awesome mod suggestion at https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/Myawesomemod14568443525

**Why do you think that this mod would fit for Ruvaak?**
I like the mod is not a good reason in my opinion

**Did you try the mod? How is the gameplay with it?**
Please provide a bit of your experience with it. Nothing crazy long but a few words would be nice, so i know what to expect.

**Did you try to add the mod to the list already?**
This is not to remove your access to support, more to check if you maybe made a necessary patch already and so on.
