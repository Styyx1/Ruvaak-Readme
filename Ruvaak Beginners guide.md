# Gameplay Guide

## Abstract
> "The nights are frightening and cruel. Every corner can hide something horrible. I feel like someone's watching me all the time. Let me give you one word of advice: You need to be prepared, always! Running away does not make one a coward, it makes one a survivor!"
- *Note: The details given below are not exhaustive and many other components exist in the list which we recommend you discover.*
- *Another Note: This is NOT your typical vanilla game. Do not expect the main quest to be an early start. Think different, try new stuff. Don't belive me? Go to Bleakfalls Barrow and tell me how far you got!*

## Initial Setup

### Realm of Lorkhan
> "Being *re*born into a strange realm that seemingly exists beyond the mortal planes, it your turn to decide on your destiny"

Feel free to explore the starting area however you see fit, and when you're ready, choose a crystal to go to your desired starting location.
A word of advice: Ruvaak's combat is harder than anything in the base game! Only choose enemy filled starting areas if you know what you are doing.

In your inventory you find a scroll named ``Choose your Destiny``, with it, you can basically choose your starting class.

### MCM Settings
Change any settings to your liking, they come pre-configured to my likings.

## Gameplay

### Perks and Skills

> "From Zero to Hero!

You will start out as a weak nobody unable to do anything without perking into the skills. That's thanks to [Synergy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72352), which makes the first perk of a skill probably the most most important one. Without the first perk you can't use crafting furniture like ``Forges or Armor Tables``, your magic requires an absurd amount of magicka and your armor is incredibly heavy, to name a few examples.
It also disables EXP gain on the perks you don't have put any perk points into. 
You start with **3 perk points** free to choose. I recommend using the perk points right away on 3 skills you plan to use as after level 1, you also need to meet certain conditions to put a perk point into the skill trees. Most skills require you to have a skill book of said perk in your inventory, to make that bit simpler, boss chests have a small chance to contain one of the skill books.

### Combat
> "Being prepared means having your offense and your defense balanced. Do not be afraid to run away to fight another day! Skyrim has many tombs and you don't want the next one to be your burial site. Be aware of vampires, these foul undead fear only silver and a stake through their hearts."

You will notice that combat is very different from the Skyrim you know. This is due to [True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) changing how movement is done, giving you the ability to attack in any direction. Through the addition of [ADXP/MCO](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/distars-mods/adxp-mco) combat animations will require you to commit to your attacks and have many more combinations for chained attacks. Also you have a separate power attack key thanks to [One Click Power Attack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60878). The key is ``share`` on controller (``M4 and M5`` on mouse by default). You can also cancel your attacks at any time with blocking due to [Combat Behavior Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3568) or by dodging out of it thanks to [TK Dodge RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956).

Enemies are now also much smarter and sport different resistances via the inclusion of [Resistances and Weaknesses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45253). Add to this new enemy types courtesy of [Rogue Like Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23872) and [Heritage 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55989) and your travels have just become a whole lot more dangerous.


### Magic

> "Learing spells is no easy task, it requires some wits and knowledge."

Magic has been overhauled by the use of [Spell Tutor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45275). Learning spell requires now multiple attempts and steps, based on your training in the magic skills. However, via the use of [Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) which improves the magic system alongside staves and scrolls, [ScrollScribe](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32439) also allows you to create new scrolls without needing to have the levels of aptitude to join the College in Winterhold.
And if that isn't enough for your magical needs, simply use the spells of your enemies via [Spell Thief](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31000)

Being an aspiring mage is hard. You have to overcome the difficulties of learning new spells while also keeping your natural resources in mind

*I recommend any mage to dive at least into 3 schools of magic and only tackle advanced questlines if you got at least 2 or 3 different types of damaging spells*

### Leveling, Crafting & Alchemy

One of the biggest changes Ruvaak makes is completely decoupling the levelling system from your character. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) makes it so your skills do not effect the character level, [Insightful Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79951) gives 'Experience Potions' to various enemies and chests. Drops are semi-random but most boss chests will contain some potions of insight. You now basically level with exploration and combat. [Crystalized Knowledge potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74888) are your main source of perk points as you don't get any with level ups except every 4th level, so keep your eye open for them. They also appear as random drops but much less frequent. 

**Basically Leveling comes down to this:**
- Character Level Ups: Exploration, quests and combat
- Skill level Ups: quests and enemy drops 
- Perk Points: every 4 levels + exploration and enemy drops

[Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487) makes small but meaningful changes to encounter zones but with the addition of [Rogue Like Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23872), there's still a chance that you will encounter enemies out of your level range. 

> "Sometimes, running is your best and only option! Don't be afraid to use it."

Another large change that Ruvaak makes is changing crafting so that you need forging manuals to craft new items. [Heim -Smithing Tweaks and Lightweight overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54207) also makes some more tweaks to make smithing more rewarding. For those not wanting to invest in crafting, you will find forgemasters across Skyrim ready to [Honed Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015) for the right price. 

Alchemy can do more than providing fancy potions and  [Badass Alchemist's Arsenal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030) shows you how powerful alchemy can be. Besides new alchemical items, [Powerful Potions and Poisons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32999) makes poisons a force to be reckoned with, but note that also your enemies can use poisons against you thanks to [NPCs Use Potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67489). It's wise to always keep one or two ``Cure Poison`` potions with you.
Some Alchemists might think that eating ingredients is a good way to learn the effects of them, I would advice against that as some effects might permanently affect you till you cure it. [Player Stats](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67622) will show you the effects if you ignore that advice. You can open the menu with ``NumPad Enter``

> BOOOOM "That sounds like a very effective method to come by a pig demon in the wild"

## Friends

> "It's dangerous to go alone! Take friends with you."

1. [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) is a fully voiced Imperial follower with around 3000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue. Though he arrives in Skyrim as a cowardly scholar, he'll gradually gain strength and confidence by your side until he grows into a hero in his own right.

2. [Xelzaz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62893) is a Custom Fully Voiced Argonian Lawman of House Telvanni with ~5550 lines. He is on his way to Rivenspire in High Rock, having traveled all the way from Port Telvannis in Morrowind. Xelzaz has just arrived in Skyrim and is looking for a traveling companion. In return he will keep you company, cook you warm meals and brew powerful potions. 

3. [Gladys the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164). Feel as though there's not enough dogs in Skyrim? Well, now you can have your own unique corgi which will happily bite the heels of your enemies!

4. [Remiel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51874), is a Breton engineer who will accompany you in your travels. She's travelled from Wayrest to explore dwemer ruins in Skyrim, but she needs your help. While she's not much of a fighter, she boasts a knack for machinery and will reprogram a dwemer spider to fight alongside you both. 
5. 
6. [Merlin the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433). Still not enough corgi in your Skyrim? Well, then you'll want to take this loveable and magical pup on the road with you! A unique combat-oriented corgi follower that will be sure to set your enemies ablaze with glee!

7. [Katana](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69622) is my favourite follower. She has a unique combat style, a unique mount and doesn't feel the need to tell me every 30 seconds how much she likes me. Check her out and do her quest.

> "Always look at the shadows and don't get greedy if you plan to survive."

## Exploration

> "Skyrim's a beautiful land, waiting to be discovered fully. Many tried before me, and many will try after me."

Ruvaak's main premise is exploration. We don't have many quest mods and the likes cause there is enough to discover in Skyrim.
[Ice Claws](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53219) adds some magical shrooms for you to find, [Hammet's Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3591326) adds a variety of dungeons to Skyrim's main land with [unique rewards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64089). Bandits are everywhere so keep an eye out for them to either avoid them or try to get their stolen treasures, they even inhabit new areas like [Skybound Underhang](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54993) or [More Bandit Camps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1994). Those who have a special eye for detail, will find some forgotten weapons with instructions to craft them and some potions that contain great knowledge. Treasures can be everywhere, might be worth it to explore underwater areas as well.
The Dwemer have also left some interesting things behind in [Blackreach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/435)

## New Locations

> "Visit strange lands undiscovered before and explore them like a true adventurer would!"

Explore [The Land of Vominheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70963) and discover the many mysterious locations it has to offer. Defeat powerful enemies and collect unique armor sets and weapons as you journey into this unforgiving land. Recent discoveries also lead to a new, desolated land, [the island of Pharos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10423) is ready to be explored by visiting an old shipwreck in the north of Skyrim. 

If you need more informations or just want learn more about the mods in use, visit the mod pages linked here or in the [Changes to gameplay document](https://github.com/chri3i/Ruvaak-Readme/blob/main/changes%20to%20gameplay.md)

## Keybinds

- for Gamepad users it's as easy as looking at [TUCS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29381). 
- changed the ``tween menu`` to be ``LB + Start`` to not accidentally dodge off a cliff anymore.

- Additionally to TUCS:
  - D-Pad Left = opens a follower menu that allows you various QOL features. works on modded followers

- for Keyboard users:
  - will be expanded once someone tells me the keys cause i don't play with kb&m

## Dungeon Guides

- [Inconvenient Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66784) removes the back entrances of a lot of dungeons so you need to backtrack again and it spawns enemies on your way out and in combination with [Locked Chests have Keys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74565) it locks the boss chests so you either need to find a key for them or you can pick the locks. For picking locks you need perks or [one of the utility perk potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79820) that allow you to pick locks for a limited amount of time.
