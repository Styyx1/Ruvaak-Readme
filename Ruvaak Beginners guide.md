# Gameplay Guide

## Abstract
> "The nights are frightening and cruel. Every corner can hide something horrible. I feel like someone's watching me all the time. Let me give you one word of advice: You need to be prepared, always! Running away does not make one a coward, it makes one a survivor!"
- *Note: The details given below are not exhaustive and many other components exist in the list which we recommend you discover.*

## Initial Setup

### Realm of Lorkhan
> "Being *re*born into a strange realm that seemingly exists beyond the mortal planes, it your turn to decide on your destiny"

Feel free to explore the starting area however you see fit, and when you're ready, choose a crystal to go to your desired starting location.
A word of advice: Ruvaak's combat is harder than anything in the base game! Only choose enemy filled starting areas if you know what you are doing.

### MCM Settings
Change any settings to your liking, they come pre-configured to my likings.

## Gameplay

### Combat
> "Being prepared means having your offense and your defense balanced. Do not be afraid to run away to fight another day! Skyrim has many tombs and you don't want the next one to be your burial site. Be aware of vampires, these foul undead fear only silver and a stake through their hearts."

You will notice that combat is very different from the Skyrim you know. This is due to [True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) changing how movement is done, giving you the ability to attack in any direction. Through the addition of [ABR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45378) combat animations will require you to commit to your attacks and have many more combinations for chained attacks. You can also cancel your attacks at any time with blocking due to [Combat Behavior Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3568).

Enemies are now also much smarter and sport different resistances via the inclusion of [Know your Enemy - Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55045) & [Know your Enemy - Armor Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55203). Add to this new enemy types courtesy of [Rogue Like Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23872) and [Heritage 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55989) and your travels have just become a whole lot more dangerous.

Reactive combat has the issue that spells are nearly impossible to dodge. Well, no more, thanks to [Action Based Projectiles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54611). It slows down arrows and spells alike without changing their reach.

### Magic

> "Learing spells is no easy task, it requires some wits and knowledge."

Magic has been overhauled by the use of [Spell Tutor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45275). Learning spell now has a chance to fail entirely, based on your training in the magic skills. However, via the use of [Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) which improves the magic system alongside staves and scrolls, [ScrollScribe](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32439) also allows you to create new scrolls without needing to have the levels of aptitude to join the College in Winterhold.
But those who really want to become a powerful mage, need to look into [Forgotten Magic Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12711), it provides the possibility to level up your spells to new heights!

### Leveling, Crafting & Alchemy

One of the biggest changes Ruvaak makes is completely decoupling the levelling system from your character. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) changes the game so that you gain experience from exploring the world, killing enemies and completing quests. Skills are **LEVEL CAPPED** to the following:

![experience levels](https://github.com/Althro/Tinvaak2/blob/main/.github/Experience%20Levelling.png?raw=true)

[Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487) makes small but meaningful changes to encounter zones but with the addition of [Rogue Like Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23872), there's still a chance that you will encounter enemies out of your level range. 

> "Sometimes, running is your best and only option! Don't be afraid to use it."

Another large change that Tinvaak makes is changing crafting so that you need forging manuals to craft new items. [Heim -Smithing Tweaks and Lightweight overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54207) also makes some more tweaks to make smithing more rewarding. For those not wanting to invest in crafting, you will find forgemasters across Skyrim ready to [Hone Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015) for the right price. 

Alchemy can do more than providing fancy potions and  [Badass Alchemist's Arsenal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030) shows you how powerful alchemy can be.

## Friends

> "It's dangerous to go alone! Take friends with you."

1. [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) is a fully voiced Imperial follower with around 3000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue. Though he arrives in Skyrim as a cowardly scholar, he'll gradually gain strength and confidence by your side until he grows into a hero in his own right.

2. [Lucifer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44967) is a fully voiced argonian adventuring companion. Despite his unnatural voice for an Argonian, he is a skilled fighter. Gain his trust and he will share what he knows about himself as he doesn't know who he really is, even though he may disagree with some of your actions, he won't leave your side.

3. [Gladys the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164). Feel as though there's not enough dogs in Skyrim? Well, now you can have your own unique corgi which will happily bite the heels of your enemies!

4. [Kaldus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58358), a strange fella who's waiting for you near Flakreath. Discover him yourself it'll be worth it!

5. [Merlin the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433). Still not enough corgi in your Skyrim? Well, then you'll want to take this loveable and magical pup on the road with you! A unique combat-oriented corgi follower that will be sure to set your enemies ablaze with glee!
