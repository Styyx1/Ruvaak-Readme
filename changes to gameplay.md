# The video game has been modified

Almost every aspect of vanilla gameplay in Ruvaak has been changed in some way. If something feels different from the vanilla game, it's almost certainly intentional and is not a bug. This document details the major changes that are present in the list along with mods that you should know about going into playing this list.

- *Note: This list is not exhaustive. Many other components to the list are not listed here deliberatly so that you can find them out.*

## Gameplay

Ruvaak uses [Ordii](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55200) as its perk overhaul. This is a slightly tweaked version of Ordinator which allows for skill caps of over 100 and uses Vokrii's skill scaling.

Various other gameplay mods used include:

1. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) drastically changes how pacing in the game is done. Rather than only getting experience on skill level ups, you now gain experience level for completing quests and killing enemies.

3. [Legacy - A race Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36415) is a racial overhaul that also impacts NPCs. It keeps the vanilla racial powers while also providing some passives for each race. Also lets you freely choose the racial you want. For example: if you want a Khajiit with Altmer powers, Legacy's got you covered.

4. [Nightmare Night - Renaissance of Werebeasts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60751) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s Werewolf system designed to balance existing Werewolf mechanics and add powerful new lycanthropic abilities to the game. This is used alongside [Simple Werewolf Favourite Howls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35736) to provide a consistent experience across both vampire lords and werebeasts.

5. [Enhanced Vampirism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61029) + [Vampyrium-Resurrected](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39749) to completely overhaul the vampire gameplay. I highly suggest checking out both mod pages to get an idea about the vampire gameplay.

6. [Heim - Smithing Tweaks and Lightweight Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54207) provides an overhaul to smithing with minimal edits to ensure compatibility. You will need to find forging manuals in order to unlock each respective category in the forge menu.

7. [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681) changes loot and encounter zones to provide an open world and immersive experience, letting the player have a sense of progression as well as obtaining believable and balanced loots throughout your adventure and exploration. 

8. [Menhir - Standing Stones of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59927) greatly changes the effects and appearance of the standing stones.

9. [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) changes dragons so that they feel like a true boss fight, with a range of new attacks and abilities. Expect dragons to offer a true battle to remember.

10. [Powerful Potions and Poisons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32999) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s alchemy to make potions and poisons far more powerful. It comes with some downsides as it also introduces **permanent stat debuffs that can only be cured with a cure poison potion (note that this debuffs are hidden)**. To avoid the worst debuffs, just don't eat ingredients to learn the effects. This is coupled with [BA Alchemist Arsenal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030) and other mods to open up many new playstyles with alchemical items.

11. [Smart Harvest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37091) is a highly customizable QOL mod to loot everything you want automatically. You can turn it off temporarily with a hotkey (G by default).

## Magic Mods

Ruvaak doesn't come with huge magic overhauls, but those in the list, have a huge impact.

1. [Triumvirate - Mage Archetypes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170) adds new mage archetypes to the game.

2. [Forgotten Magic Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12711) adds a few very powerful spells to the game which are possible to further enhance with perks unique to each spell.

3. [Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) is an overhaul that fixes bugs in Vanilla spells, fills in gaps in the game's magic progression, and adds new spells from previous Elder Scrolls titles. 

4. [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s enchanting system designed to balance existing enchantments and add powerful new weapon and armor enchantments to the game. 

5. [The Path of Transcendence - Lichdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25654)  is a light-weight lichdom mod designed to compliment many other Necromancy themed Mods such as Ordinator's necromancy

6. [Spell Tutor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45275) is a highly adjustable mod for spell learning. Select conditions and method for learning. Keep or destroy the book. Unlearn already known spell and more. Check out the mod page and the MCM of it to learn more


## Combat Mods

Ruvaak completely reworks combat to be more action based than vanilla.

1. [Normal Attack Stamina Consumption - NASC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32996) changes how attacks work so that stamina matters. You need stamina to attack and it drains stamina while doing so (adjustable in the MCM).

2. [Seamless Combat Camera](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53856) changes how the combat camera works. Ruvaak is designed for 3rd person combat and this mod forces the camera into 3rd person view.

3. [Attack Behavior Revamp](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45378) introduces attack commitment **after the first swing**, so you can't freely turn around during attacks. The same is true for NPCs. It also gives you the ability to chains dual weapon attacks and left handed attacks.

4.  [CGO Stripped](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60258) is a leight weight alternative to the popular CGO mod. This mod allows jumping attacks and it also introduces leaning while moving (adjustable in the MCM).

## Quest and Encounter Mods

Ruvaak comes with a wide variety of new quest and encounters. A few are listed below.

1. [At your own Pace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704) is a series of mods that overhaul the pace of some quests like the main quest. If a quest doesn't preceed as expected in vanilla, chances are it's this series of mod. Check out the mod page to see how the quests are structured now.

2. [HeadHunter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51847) expands bounty quests for Bandits, Forsworn, Giants and Dragons. Like in the Witcher 3, you can bring "trophies" from your enemy to the Jarl as proof of the bounty or deliver the captured bandits to a guard for justice.

3. [End Times of Dawnguard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61087) gives a feeling of urgence to the Dawnguard questline. Now you can't simply start the quest and forget forever about it. Harkon has plans and he will go after Auriel's bow if you don't stop him.

4. [Rogue-Like Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23872), [Coven - A witch overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51596), [Heritage Enemies 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55989) and [High Level Enemies Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32801) form the core of the expanded enemy system. Encounters will no longer be simple affiars, with a larger variety of bandits and more of them. Expect the unexpected.

5. [Open World Bosses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6117) adds a few MMO-Like creatures into the game. Don't expect to stand a chance against them early on.

6. [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) adds a large number of localized radiant quests found at Missive Boards of varying difficulty and with varying rewards. 

7. [The Sinister Seven](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19178) assures you, that you are not alone in the world and somebody is after your character

## Expanded Cities Towns and Villages

Ruvaak is relatively easy in terms of city overhauls but it adds a few new settlements as well.

1. [Enhanced Town and Cities - ETaC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13552) is used as the city overhaul of choice, further enhanced by mods like [Illustrious Whiterun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28950) and [Northfire's Windhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44099)

2. [Settlements Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7777) expands various locations throughout Skyrim by adding NPCs and buidings to them.

3. [More Bandit Camps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1994) ensures that not only friendly NPCs have expanded their settlements


## Followers

Skyrim can be a lonely place, and the battles can be tough. Thankfully, there are a few new followers that are ready and willing to carry your burdens without complaining about them.

1. [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) is a fully voiced Imperial follower with around 3000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue. Though he arrives in Skyrim as a cowardly scholar, he'll gradually gain strength and confidence by your side until he grows into a hero in his own right.

2. [Lucifer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44967) is a fully voiced Argonian follower with over 5K lines of dialogue and custom built features. Despite his unnatural voice for an Argonian, he is a skilled fighter. Gain his trust and he will share what he knows about himself as he doesn't know who he really is, even though he may disagree with some of your actions, he won't leave your side. 

3. [Gladys the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164). Feel as though there's not enough dogs in Skyrim? Well now you can have your own unique corgi which will happily bite the heels of your enemies!

4. [Merlin the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433). Still not enough corgi in your Skyrim? Well then you'll want to take this loveable and magical pup on the road with you! A unique combat-oriented corgi follower that will be sure to set your enemies ablaze with glee!

5. [Kaldus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58358) is a unique follower with a rather unique appearance. 

## Music and Weather

A modlist wouldn't be complete without a few new soundtracks and a weather upgrade. Ruvaak utilises a few mods to help achieve that whilst still keeping the iconic soundtrack that we all know and love.

1. [Obsidian Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125) is the weather mod of choice for Ruvaak. Pairing with the ENB perfectly, it provides the perfect backdrop for the list.

2. [Personalized Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2572) + [Dark Era](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39746) provide the music to give the feeling i was going for with the list

3. [Audio Overhaul Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) does what it pretty much says on the tin. Expect sounds to feel more relistic and, well, overhauled.

4. [Immersive Sounds Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523) provides a dramatic and marked update to many of the sounds in the game. This is merged with AOS to create the perfect overhaul to the sounds in game.

## Survival & Immersion

Ruvaak is by no means a heavily roleplaying focused list but there are some mods that make it possible on a pretty basic level.

1. [CC Survival mode](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Survival_Mode) is further enhanced by mods like [Conner's Survival Mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19152), [Survival Control Panel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41891), [Sleep under the Stars](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20548) and [Frost Resist provides Warmth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61272)

2. [CC Camping](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Camping) lets you build basic campsides. It works with Survival mode turned off as well in case you don't like survival elements but still want to build campsites.

3. [Pick your Poison](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23710) gives you books that list the alchemical ingredients and their effects.

4. **IMPORTANT REMINDER ABOUT INGREDIENTS** - Do NOT eat them to find out the effects, they will give you stackable permanent debuffs
