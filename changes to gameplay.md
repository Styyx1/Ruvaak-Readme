# The video game has been modified

Almost every aspect of vanilla gameplay in Ruvaak has been changed in some way. If something feels different from the vanilla game, it's almost certainly intentional and is not a bug. This document details the major changes that are present in the list along with mods that you should know about going into playing this list.

- *Note: This list is not exhaustive. Many other components to the list are not listed here deliberatly so that you can find them out.*

## Gameplay

Ruvaak uses [Synergy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72352) as its perk overhaul. This perk mod restricts the way you play and lets you focus more on class like builds. Choose your perks wisely as they are very important. You need skill books to be able to unlock the first perks of a tree

Various other gameplay mods used include:

1. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) drastically changes how pacing in the game is done. Rather than getting experience on skill level ups, you now gain experience level for completing quests and killing enemies.

2. [Insightful Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79951) gives you potions that allow you to level your skills. You don't need to drink the potions 1 by 1, the power allows you consume them all at once. 

3. [Phylogeny - Races of Tamriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44371) removes most racial powers in favor of new passives. Passives apply to npcs as well as the player.

4. [Nightmare Night - Renaissance of Werebeasts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60751) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s Werewolf system designed to balance existing Werewolf mechanics and add powerful new lycanthropic abilities to the game. This is used alongside [Simple Werewolf Favourite Howls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35736) to provide a consistent experience across both vampire lords and werebeasts.

5. [Curse of the Vampire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10086) and [Vampyrium-Resurrected](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39749) to completely change the vampire gameplay. Feeding is now only a chance to heal yourself and you get special perk by joining different vampire clans. I highly recommend checking out both mods' description if you plan on playing a vampire character.

6. [Heim - Smithing Tweaks and Lightweight Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54207) provides an overhaul to smithing with minimal edits to ensure compatibility. You will need to find forging manuals in order to unlock each respective category in the forge menu.

7. [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681) changes loot and encounter zones to provide an open world and immersive experience, letting the player have a sense of progression as well as obtaining believable and balanced loots throughout your adventure and exploration. 

8. [Doomstones](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80180)greatly changes the effects of the standing stones and their appearance comes from [Menhir - Standing Stones of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64661).

9. [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) changes dragons so that they feel like a true boss fight, with a range of new attacks and abilities. Expect dragons to offer a true battle to remember.

## Magic Mods

Ruvaak doesn't come with huge magic overhauls, but those in the list, have a huge impact.

1. [Triumvirate - Mage Archetypes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170) adds new mage archetypes to the game.

2. [Odin - Skyrim Magic Overhaul ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) is what magic in Skyrim should have been. It improves and fixes vanilla Skyrim spells, makes scrolls and staves viable, and adds new spells, scrolls and staves inspired by previous Elder Scrolls magic. The new content is balanced and seamlessly integrated into the game.

3. [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s enchanting system designed to balance existing enchantments and add powerful new weapon and armor enchantments to the game. 

4. [The Path of Transcendence - Lichdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25654)  is a light-weight lichdom mod designed to compliment many other Necromancy themed Mods such as Ordinator's necromancy

5. [Spell Thief](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31000) allows you to steal enemy spells and use them as if they were your own.

6.  [Spell Tutor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45275) is a highly adjustable mod for spell learning. Select conditions and method for learning. Keep or destroy the book. Unlearn already known spell and more. Check out the mod page and the MCM of it to learn more

7.  [Natura](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77826), [Necrom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86292), [Lunaris](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80852), [Bloodmoon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84304) and [Abyss](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83329) are themed spell packs for a variety of builds.


## Combat Mods

Ruvaak completely reworks combat to be a bit slow paced but action based and heavily 3rd person focused. While it shares similarities with Souls games, it is by no means meant to replicate or mimic it!

1. [SCAR - Skyrim Combat AI Revolution](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72014) lets Enemies use attack combos and better strategies in combat. NPCs check the range of distance and angle as well as other conditions before every strike, pick up the attack action that meet the criteria, then perform it.

2. [ADXP/MCO](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/distars-mods/adxp-mco) combat animations will require you to commit to your attacks and have many more combinations for chained attacks.

3.  [Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347). Please check out the mod page. It changes too much to summarise here

4. [Paulicus Poison Block (PPB) Updated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51046) is a small, immersive mod that allows the player and NPCs to block incoming poison damage and disease effects when successfully blocking with a shield/weapon or ward spell.

5. [Chocolate Poise](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70478) gives you some stagger resistance like modern action combat games also have. 

6. [Elden Parry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70240) SKSE plugin that replaces vanilla Skyrim's bash with a parrying mechanism to spice up Skyrim's combat. 

7. [Blade and Blunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549) a complete change to your resource management in combat and the overall pace of combat.

## Quest and Encounter Mods

Ruvaak comes with a wide variety of new quest and encounters. A few are listed below.

1. [Nightbringer - Grim Reaper Enemy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14691) Adds a 'Grim Reaper'-inspired enemy to the game that will hunt you starting at level 19.

2. [HeadHunter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51847) expands bounty quests for Bandits, Forsworn, Giants and Dragons. Like in the Witcher 3, you can bring "trophies" from your enemy to the Jarl as proof of the bounty or deliver the captured bandits to a guard for justice.

3. [TDF Equipment Restriction](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22830) adds skill requirements to weapons, armors and spells so you can't get lucky and use the ebony axe you found somewhere at level 1. Highly adjustable in its MCM.

4. [Rogue-Like Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23872), [Coven - A witch overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51596), [Heritage Enemies 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55989), [The Dragon Cult](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81422) and [Rogues 'N Raiders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47504) form the core of the expanded enemy system. Encounters will no longer be simple affiars, with a larger variety of bandits and more of them. Expect the unexpected.

5. [Hand Placed Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59249) and [More Draugr Outside Tombs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80142) will add more enemy density to the world.

6. [Open World Bosses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6117) adds a few MMO-Like creatures into the game. Don't expect to stand a chance against them early on.

7. [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) adds a large number of localized radiant quests found at Missive Boards of varying difficulty and with varying rewards. 

8. [The Sinister Seven ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19178) assures you, that you are not alone in the world and somebody is after your character. The Encounters are better balanced but hard to manage early on, be prepared to run and get hunted down! 

**Sinister Seven is heavily modified by me to make it manageable from the start but still hard till you're at a high level.**


## Expanded Cities Towns and Villages

Ruvaak is relatively easy in terms of city overhauls but it adds a few new settlements as well.

1. [Spaghetti's Cities](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/36481565?tab=user+files) provides some minor but meaningful overhauls to cities while not cluttering everything, further enhanced by mods like [Illustrious Whiterun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28950) and [MRF's Windhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65256) or [Riften of Reverie](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65596)

2. [Settlements Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7777) expands various locations throughout Skyrim by adding NPCs and buidings to them.

3. [More Bandit Camps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1994) ensures that not only friendly NPCs have expanded their settlements

## New Lands and Quests

While Ruvaak is focused on enhancing what is in the base game, we also have a few additions.

1. [New Vominheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70963) *"A thousand years ago there was a powerful necromancer named Vuldur who lived in Vominheim. Together with his cultist group they ruled over the island with force and intimidation until one day a young nord prince Valdgar stood up and wage war against them. Eventually Vuldur and his group were defeated and they retreated to another realm."*

2. [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565) The East Empire Company commissions the Dragonborn to slay a dragon that is interrupting trade routes throughout Skyrim. But is the dragon stirring up trouble with a particular reason and what sinister motive does it have for its actions? 

3. [A lot of dungeon mods from this author](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3591326) there are too many to list them, but I'm quite a fan of this mod author and the amount of dungeons from them reflects that.

4. [Darkend](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10423) "Travel to the new island of Pharos, explore detailed environments, fight new enemies and discover an Ancient set of weapons of incredible power. No quest, no holding hand, heavily inspired by The Demon's/Dark Souls games."

5. [Clockwork](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4155) is a quest mod involving a castle high in the Velothi Mountains, lost to the world for over a hundred years. Once found, you may call Clockwork Castle home... but if you want to leave, you'll need to discover how to escape.

6. [Inconvenient Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66784) removes or otherwise alters many backexits from Vanilla dungeons. And its addon secures some fun on your way back as well.

7. [Locked Chests have Keys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74565) Many chests in Skyrim are locked... but truth is no one has the key to open them. Do bandits pick the lock every time? With this mod, most locked chests will have a nearby hidden key that can be used to open the chest. You can still pick the lock as usual, but you can now also use the key... if you manage to find it! 

## Followers

Skyrim can be a lonely place, and the battles can be tough. Thankfully, there are a few new followers that are ready and willing to carry your burdens without complaining about them.

1. [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) is a fully voiced Imperial follower with around 3000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue. Though he arrives in Skyrim as a cowardly scholar, he'll gradually gain strength and confidence by your side until he grows into a hero in his own right.

2. [Xelzaz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62893) Voiced Argonian Lawman of House Telvanni. He is on his way to Rivenspire in High Rock, having traveled all the way from Port Telvannis in Morrowind. Xelzaz has just arrived in Skyrim and is looking for a traveling companion. In return he will keep you company, cook you warm meals and brew powerful potions. 

3. [Gladys the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164). Feel as though there's not enough dogs in Skyrim? Well now you can have your own unique corgi which will happily bite the heels of your enemies!

4. [Merlin the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433). Still not enough corgi in your Skyrim? Well then you'll want to take this loveable and magical pup on the road with you! A unique combat-oriented corgi follower that will be sure to set your enemies ablaze with glee!

5. [Remiel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51874) a Breton engineer who will accompany you in your travels. While she's not much of a fighter, she boasts a knack for machinery and will reprogram a dwemer spider to fight alongside you both.

6. [Katana](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69622) is a fairly new mod but already my favourite follower. She has a unique combat style, a unique mount and doesn't feel the need to tell me every 30 seconds how much she likes me. Check her out and do her quest.

## Music and Sound

A modlist wouldn't be complete without a few new soundtracks and a weather upgrade. Ruvaak utilises a few mods to help achieve that whilst still keeping the iconic soundtrack that we all know and love.

1. [Personalized Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2572) + [Dark Era](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39746) provide the music to give the feeling i was going for with the list.

2. [Audio Overhaul Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) does what it pretty much says on the tin. Expect sounds to feel more relistic and, well, overhauled.

3. [Immersive Sounds Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523) provides a dramatic and marked update to many of the sounds in the game. This is merged with AOS to create the perfect overhaul to the sounds in game.

## Survival & Immersion

Ruvaak is by no means a heavily roleplaying focused list but there are some mods that make it possible on a pretty basic level.

1. [CC Survival mode](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Survival_Mode) is further enhanced by mods like [Survival Mode Improved - SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78244), [Survival Control Panel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41891) and [Frost Resist provides Warmth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61272).

2. [CC Camping](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Camping) lets you build basic campsides. It works with Survival mode turned off as well in case you don't like survival elements but still want to build campsites.

3. [Pick your Poison](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23710) gives you books that list the alchemical ingredients and their effects.

4. [Natural Character Growth and Decay](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76676) makes it so Health, Magicka, Stamina and Carry Weight will naturally grow and Decay according to your playstyle independent of level or skills. You need to sleep to get rid of the accumulated stress for the attributes. It's highly adjustable in its MCM and you can even turn on the vanilla attributes on top of it in its MCM (not advised though, as you'll end up with pretty high attributes early on).

# Note: In Ruvaak you only get half the attribute points per level up, that is intentional

5. [Potions of Obtainable Progress](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74888) is a mod that adds perk point potions hidden in the world if you ever feel like you need that one extra point for your build.

**For Ruvaak the mod is adjusted so that you have the chance of one perk potion as a drop from certain enemies as well and it is the only reliable way to get perk points**

6. [Honed Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015) Blacksmiths and mages all over Skyrim will be able to craft, temper and enchant your equipment, including armor and weapons added by mods. The quality and price of their work will depend on their skill as craftsmen as well as your barter abilities. Fully customizable through an MCM menu.

7. [Progressive Encumbrance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73300). Gain movement speed penalties depending on how much you are carrying and how much you can carry. Makes you very slow if you run around like a walking storage room, so, I recommend turning off the movement speed modifier and the one for swimming in case it is not turned off by default.

8. [Elemental Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76336) Alters magic resists based on the current weather, rain for example, will give fire resistance and shock weakness.

 ## **IMPORTANT REMINDER ABOUT INGREDIENTS** - Do NOT eat them to find out the effects, they will give you stackable permanent debuffs. You can check your stats like resistances with ``Numpad Enter``
